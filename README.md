# health_campaign
This project simulates an ETL pipeline and dashboard for healthcare data, modeled after a real Health Information Exchange (HIE) system I developed. Due to confidentiality, I generated random datasets to showcase skills in data integration, campaign effectiveness analysis, and visualization using Airflow and Plotly in a simplified context.
